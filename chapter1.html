						<h2>Why Learn About Nanotechnology?</h2>
						<p>At the heart of the 21st century Technology Revolution lies nanotechnology – and the knowledge and skills you will gain from this course will help you prepare for a career in this modern workforce. Not only will engineers and scientists need to be familiar with nanotechnology, but even business executives, healthcare providers, politicians, and professional athletes will greatly gain from an understanding of nanotechnology. Worldwide, there is a well-recognized relationship between education in science and engineering and innovation and prosperity.1 Learning nanotechnology today will provide you with the expertise necessary to navigate the rapidly innovating high-tech economy of the near future.</p>

						<p>What kind of science is nanotechnology?: Nanotechnology is the manipulation of very tiny materials based on concepts from chemistry, physics, materials science, engineering, molecular biology, computer science, and mathematics. In other words, it is a highly interdisciplinary domain of STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics). Although it is a relatively new field, nanotechnology can be understood using existing laws, theories, and principles of these traditional sciences.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="rightCol">
						<p>Where is nanotechnology going to be used?: Nanotechnology is predicted to find novel solutions to age-old problems, altering the fields of medicine, energy production and storage, environmental conservation, communication, and computation as we know them – just to name a few. Nanotechnology is also expected to dramatically improve the next generation of many everyday products, ranging from batteries and computer chips to cosmetics to water purifiers. These products and related services are expected to be at the base of a new, global multitrillion-dollar economy that soon will affect millions of jobs, both directly and indirectly.</p>

						<p>What is different at the nanoscale?: Nanoscale materials display novel chemical,  electrical, mechanical, and optical properties compared to the same material at the larger, “bulk” scale. When at least one dimension of any material is confined to the nanoscale, it is referred to as “nanomaterial” and its unique properties can be utilized for nanotechnology. Nanomaterials are capable of producing goods with higher computational speed, increased energy efficiency, and superior mechanical strength. For example, nanotechnology-enabled photovoltaics (solar cells) harvest solar energy much more efficiently than current solar panels, resulting in a much higher output of electricity from the same amount of captured sunlight. Imagine if all of our electricity was generated by solar energy! You will learn this and much more in this course.</p>

						<p>What is in this chapter?: This chapter will provide you with an overview of the fundamental principles and applications of this exciting new discipline of nanotechnology. In this chapter, we begin with a basic definition of nanotechnology and discuss the scale and size at which it operates. You will understand the major historical events in science and engineering that paved the way to nanotechnology, and learn how it differs from and compliments biotechnology. We will discuss what makes nanomaterials unique with respect to bulk materials, learn how they are fabricated, explore how the unique properties of nanomaterials can be exploited for the evolution of a wide array of consumer goods, and look at the estimated timeline in which consumers are expected to adopt these nanotechnology-enabled products en masse.

						<p>Broad overview of nanotechnology: Nanotechnology is a highly interdisciplinary field that utilizes concepts from chemistry, physics, materials science, electrical and mechanical engineering, molecular biology, computer science, and applied mathematics. Nanotechnology lies at the intersection of these STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) disciplines, as illustrated in Figure 1.2.</p>

						<p>Nanotechnology aims to find solutions to long-standing, real-world societal concerns in the fields of medicine, energy production and storage, environmental conservation, communication, computation, and homeland security (Figure 1.1).

						<p>What does “nano” mean?: The prefix “nano” means “one billionth,” or 10-9.  Thus a nanometer is one billionth of a meter (one billionth of about 39.37 inches), and is abbreviated as “nm.”</p>
						<p>What is the technical definition of nanotechnology?: Nanotechnology is the understanding and control of matter at dimensions between approximately 1 and 100 nanometers (nm), where unique chemical and physical phenomena enable new applications previously unachievable with bulk materials. Related terminology includes the terms nanoscience, nanoscale, nanomaterials, nanoengineering, and nanotechnologist, which are explained below:</p>

						<p><strong>Nanoscience</strong>: Nanoscience studies the nature and behavior, and thus the properties, of materials whose dimensions are confined between about 1 and 100 nm (called nanoscale). The properties of these materials originate from their tiny size and shape, and can be explained and predicted using known laws, theories, and principles of chemistry, physics, biology, and mathematics. Similarly to other sciences, nanoscience uses the scientific method of inquiry to study the observed properties and phenomena of these tiny materials. </p>					
					</div>
					<div class="rightCol">
						<p><strong>Nanoscale</strong>: Nanoscale is a scale of measurements in which the multiplier 10-9, or the prefix “nano,” defines its order of magnitude. For instance, the dimensions of nanomaterials are measured in nanometers, where “nano” defines the “scale” or “order of magnitude” of the dimension measured, and meter is the unit of measurement for linear dimensions (e.g., length). “Nanometers” are typically used to define dimensions between 0.1 nm (10-10 m) and 100 nm (10-7 m). These dimensions are much smaller than the resolution of the human eye and therefore can only be seen with the aid of powerful microscopes. The dimensions of objects or items smaller than 0.1 nm are usually defined in terms of “picometers” (10-12 m) and objects larger than 100 nm are typically measured in “micrometers” (10-6 m). A complete overview of the scale of measurement is provided in Section 1.8.4, “Standard prefixes for SI units.” Nanoscale terminology, besides being used to indicate dimensions, can also be used to indicate the order of magnitude of other measurable quantities such as electrical current, voltage, and time.</p>

						<p><strong>Nanomaterials</strong>: Nanomaterials are materials whose dimensions are confined to the nanoscale. To qualify as a nanomaterial, only one dimension of a material – its length, width, or height/thickness – needs to be at the nanoscale (see Section 1.1.2). For comparison, the size of nanomaterials relative to other well-known materials is shown in Figure 1.3. </p>

						<p>Clearly, nanomaterials are much smaller than any living entity (even including single bacterium). The size of the smallest nanomaterials is comparable to that of molecules, such as caffeine, and biological macromolecules, such as antibodies and nucleic acids. Nanomaterials cannot be seen by the naked eye or under optical microscopes, but can be imaged using powerful microscopy techniques, which we’ll learn about in Chapter 2.</p>
						<p><strong>Nanoengineering</strong>: Nanoengineering is the work of creating structures, devices, and systems with nanomaterials in order to utilize their unique properties. The work of nanoengineers eventually results in novel or improved commercial products using nanomaterials.</p>
						<p><strong>Nanotechnologist</strong>: A nanotechnologist is typically a scientist or an engineer who works with, researches, utilizes, or studies nanomaterials. Nanotechnologists typically hold advanced degrees in chemistry, physics, materials science, electrical or mechanical engineering, applied mathematics, or applied computer science. As this new field of research becomes increasingly recognized by institutions of higher education, formal degrees in nanoscience and nanoengineering are expected to emerge.</p>

						<h2>Overview of Nanomaterials</h2>
						<p>Getting to know nanomaterials: Nanomaterials are manmade materials, of characteristic sizes and shapes, which enable all the applications of nanotechnology. Take some time to visualize the most common nanomaterials and familiarize yourself with their names, dimensions, and shape, summarized in Table 1.1. These nanomaterials will be extensively discussed in this chapter and others, including Chapters 7 (Carbon-Based Nanomaterials), 9 (Nanoparticles), and 21 (Nanowires). The first three nanomaterials listed in the table are made entirely of carbon atoms: (A) buckyballs, soccer ball-shaped carbon molecules; (B) nanotubes, pipe- or tube-like carbon structures, 1-atom thick and hollow inside; and (C) graphene, a flat, continuous sheet of carbon atoms, 1-atom thick. Other widely used nanomaterials include (D) nanowires, wire-like materials; (E)-(F) nanoparticles, quasi-spherical clusters of a small number of atoms; (G) quantum dots, quasi-spherical aggregations of semiconductor compounds capable of emitting light; and (H) nanoliposomes, relatively large spherical aggregations of organic and biological molecules. </p>

						<p>Describing dimensionality at the nanoscale: Nanomaterials and nanostructures can be confined to the nanoscale at one, two, or all three dimensions. In everyday life we deal with bulk materials, which are generally macroscopic in scale across all three dimensions, and are thus three-dimensional (3D). </p>

						<p>For example, although a sheet of paper is quite thin, its thickness can easily be measured by a caliper and is, indeed, visible to the naked eye, so it is still considered 3D. Nanomaterials, on the other hand, need not be confined to the nanoscale in all three dimensions to be considered “nano,” as shown in Figure 1.4. For instance, spherical nanoparticles are confined to the nanoscale, typically between 1 and 100 nm, along all three dimensions (Figure 1.4A). Carbon nanotubes have two dimensions confined at the nanoscale, both thickness and cross section (or diameter), which is typically between 1 and 3 nm for a single-walled nanotube. The length of a nanotube, on the other hand, is typically much greater than 1 micrometer (10-6 m) (Figure 1.4B). Graphene sheets have only one dimension at the nanoscale, their thickness, which is equivalent to the thickness of a plane of carbon atoms (0.335 nm), as shown in Figure 1.4C. The lateral dimensions of graphene are generally on the micrometer or millimeter (10-3 m) scale.</p>

						<h2>Aspect ratio and other dimensional jargon for describing nanomaterials</h2>
						<p>Dimensional jargon: Be aware that the dimensional jargon scientists use to describe nanomaterials are often named after mathematical concepts, geometrical figures, and aspect ratio, rather than the number of dimensions confined at the nanoscale. </p>
						<p>What is the aspect ratio?: The aspect ratio is commonly defined as the ratio of the width (x) of an item to its height (y), and is expressed as “x:y.” Aspect ratio is usually used to describe an object whose width is greater than its height, such as televisions and computer displays, as shown in Figure 1.5. The aspect ratio is almost never used when height is greater than width, as for buildings or towers. </p>
						<p>
							<ul>
								<li>1D nanomaterials: Nanotubes and nanowires are often referred as one-dimensional (1D) nanomaterials because their length (x) is generally thousands of times larger than their diameter (y), as shown in Figure 1.6B. Even if nanotubes or nanowires have two dimensions confined at the nanoscale, they are typically referred to as “1D” or “linear” nanomaterials, as they resemble the mathematical concept of a “line.” </li>

						<p>
							<ul>
								<li>2D nanomaterials: Graphene is typically referred to as “2D” or “planar” nanomaterial, even though it has only one dimension confined at the nanoscale (its thickness, y). In fact, graphene has a large aspect ratio between the “height” of the graphene sheet (thickness, y) and both of its two lateral dimensions (x), as shown in Figure 1.6C. 2D nanomaterials resemble the mathematical concept of a “plane.”</li>
								<li>3D nanomaterials: Large spherical nanoparticles, such as nanoliposomes, are typically referred as 3D nanomaterials, because all the three dimensions (x, y, and z) are confined at the nanoscale. These x, y, and z dimensions are almost identical, resulting in an aspect ratio of one, as shown in Figure 1.6D. Because their diameters are in the hundreds of nanometers, they are considered 3D materials in sharp contrast to the smallest nanoparticles, which are considered 0D. </li>
								<li>0D nanomaterials: Buckyballs, quantum dots, and the smallest nanoparticles, while having all three dimensions (x, y, and z) confined at the nanoscale, are typically referred as “zero-dimensional” materials. This is because they are so small that resemble the non-dimensional concept of a “point” in mathematics (Figure 1.6A).</li>
